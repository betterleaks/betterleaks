# Known finding count differences between gitleaks and betterleaks.

# These are documented, expected divergences — the harness will tolerate them

# Fields:
#   repo:   repository name (basename)
#   mode:   scan mode (git or dir)
#   rule:   rule ID
#   delta:  count difference (negative = betterleaks reports fewer)
#   reason: explanation of why the difference exists

    gitleaks reports the same secret twice on the same line (README.md:29)
